	<h3>FIRST ENTRY</h3>
	<p>
		Hi my name is <em>David Vicente Moya</em>, I'm an 18 years old spanish guy.
		Currently I'm taking a degree in Video Game Design and Development at UJI. Following the advice of one of my techers I'm creating a portfolio where I can link all my progress so future me can find a job more easily. I was a bit esceptical about this at first, I didn't find my work "good enough" to use in my portfolio, but I recently found the motivation to do so.
	</p>
	<p>
		You might be wandering <i>why?</i> would I want to learn html scripting, well... Being able to learn new skills is vital in life and having the freedom and control over my portfolio is really appealing. Even thought I'm pretty sure I will never have to make a project in html that won't stop me from learning new things.</p>

		<p><h4>My first objectives are:</h4>
			<dl>
				<dt>Start doing something</dt>
					<small>
						<dd><b>-</b> Just trying to get a grasp of html language will be enough.</dd>
					</small>
				<dt>Add links and resources</dt>
					<small>
						<dd><b>-</b> It's true that I called this page a web prototype, but my true motive behind this webpage is creating my very own unique portfolio. It may beacome not the greatest but will demonstrate my capabilities at programming and game development.</dd>
					</small>
				<dt>Add original images</dt>
					<small>
						<dd><b>-</b> This will take some time. It's not a priority but I feel like putting it here.</dd>
